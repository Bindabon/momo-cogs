# momo-cogs
some redbot cogs that i made for momo bot but people can use it for free.



This twitter cog uses tweepy so you have to do `pip install tweepy` and also edit the api key to your own keys.
        
       api_key = ""
       api_secret = ""
       access_token = ""
       access_token_secret = ""

paste your own keys from https://developer.twitter.com/en/application/

For instagram cog you have to buy an api from https://rapidapi.com/contact-cmWXEDTql/api/instagram-unofficial/pricing and then you can use it also you have to replace api keys on cog too. this cog uses asyncio-throttle so you have to do `pip install asyncio-throttle`.

enjoy the cogs but dont forget to donate : https://www.paypal.me/ksinging
